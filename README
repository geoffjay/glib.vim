This syntax file, written by my friend Jason Thomas, adds to your existing C syntax file many of the extra types and so forth given to you by the excellent glib library from http://www.gtk.org/

It is believed to be complete (at least for 1.2.x), though feel free to submit patches if you find something missing.
